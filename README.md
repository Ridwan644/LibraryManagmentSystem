# Library Management System (Group Project)

This repository contains a group project completed for our Software Engineering course.  
The application includes a **React frontend**, **Node.js/Express backend**, and **SQLite database**, with full CRUD operations, search functionality, reporting, and a structured API layer.

This repository is uploaded to my GitHub for **portfolio and transparency** purposes.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Group Collaboration & Transparency

This project was developed collaboratively as a team.  
Everyone contributed to different parts of the system, and the final result reflects a shared effort across planning, design, and implementation.

### ✅ **My Contributions**
Throughout the project, I contributed to both **engineering design** and **development**, including:

- **Creating and refining UML diagrams** (class, sequence, workflow)
- **Designing the overall architecture and system structure**
- **Contributing to frontend and backend code development**
- **Building documentation and organizing technical requirements**
- **Developing presentation slides and explaining system functionality**
- **Participating in debugging, feature integration, and code review**
- **Researching system requirements, libraries, and API needs**

These responsibilities ensured the system was well-designed, implementable, and aligned with engineering standards.

### 🤝 **Team Collaboration**
Code implementation, planning, documentation, and testing were all shared among group members.  
We worked together to ensure features were functioning, the API was structured correctly, and the frontend and backend communicated properly.

This README is written to maintain transparency and acknowledge that the project reflects **shared teamwork and joint contributions**.

## 📌 Why This Code Is on My GitHub

The project is included in my GitHub because:

1. I contributed to its **design, architecture, documentation, diagrams, and code**.  
2. It demonstrates my understanding of **full-stack development workflow**.  
3. It showcases teamwork, version control usage, and engineering practices.  
4. It provides a real example of a structured, multi-component software system.  

This is not an attempt to claim sole authorship — it represents my contributions within a group.
